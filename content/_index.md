#     description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

# Biography

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. I received a PhD degree in May 2015 in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the USA (advisors: Virgil Gligor, Osman Yagan; collaborator: Adrian Perrig), affiliating with CMU's renowned CyLab Security & Privacy Institute, and a bachelor's degree in July 2010 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China. 

Before joining NTU first as a postdoc with Xiaokui Xiao and then as a faculty member, I was a postdoc at Arizona State University (ASU) as an Arizona Computing PostDoc Best Practices Fellow (advisors: Junshan Zhang, Vincent Poor). 


# Research Interests

My research interests include blockchain, edge/fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), signal processing, AI security, adversarial machine learning, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and data privacy.
